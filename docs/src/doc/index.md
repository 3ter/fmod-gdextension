Godot C++ GDExtension for Godot 4 that provides an integration for the FMOD Studio API.

FMOD is an audio engine and middleware solution for interactive audio in games. It has been the audio engine behind many
titles such as Transistor, Into the Breach and Celeste. [More on FMOD's website](https://www.fmod.com/).

This GDExtension exposes most of the Studio API functions to Godot's GDScript and also provides helpers ands nodes for
performing common functions like attaching Studio events to Godot nodes and playing 3D/positional audio. Feel free to
tweak/extend it based on your project's needs.
